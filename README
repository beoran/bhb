==========================================================================

Introduction

Broken Hearts Batte intends to become a lowpoly 3D fighting game which feels 
somewhat like "Rival Schools", and is a homage to the visual novel Katawa 
Shoujo.The models will be made in Blender. The first version of the game will 
be programmed using the Blender game engine, so it will be portable to Windows, 
Linux and OS X.

Nothingg much is there yet, but poke ariund in the various .blend files to see
what's going on.

Setting
-------

Broken High is a private charitable high school somewhere in 
a remote countryside location in Europe that aims to give "problem youths" a 
second chance in life. Unlike most schools of it's kind, it does not take a 
repressive approach. It tries to reintegrate and prepare the pupils for life 
in society, not for a life in prison. 

To be able to do this, the school is selective, and only accepts students who 
sign a promise to their best to reintegrate in society. It has a bit of a good 
reputation as most pupils can graduate. Therefore, upper class families, even 
from other countries send their "black sheep" to the school have them 
"sorted out". Those pupils have even come to form the majority of the school's 
population, and contribute to the school's ample funding. To give children form 
ordinary families a chance, their fees are lessened or even waived.

The schools allows the pupils to have rebellious hair or looks, as long as they 
flollow the impotant rules. The school is mixed, and actually has more girls 
than boys because most of them have a lighter criminal record. After school 
hours and in week ends, the pupils may wander freely into the village nearby or 
even visit the city by train. During holidays, those who are able to do so are 
allowed to visit their families.

However the pupils are required to attend class and to return to the dorms after 
curfew, and their presence is electronically checked through chip badges. 
Cell phones are not allowed and actively jammed, both pupils and teachers must 
use the school's fixed phones. There are also surveillance cameras in public 
areas to record any problems. The school is fenced, and the main gate also 
closes and locks at night.

Although some pupils feel resentful, most take the chance offered seriously
and and try to make the best of it. And although they'd be loathe to admit it, 
most of them are glad to be there, and even proud of the school and it's 
teachers. 

Story
-----

One warm fall in 20XX, Harry, a new pupil joined the last grade in Broken High 
after a knife was found in his satchel in his old school... but he claims he 
had no bad intentions. Nevertheless, to prove he is sincere, he is determined to 
graduate from in Broken High. Although new, soon Harry proved to be popular in 
his own way, and he was soon, apart from a few exceptions, 
well liked by his peers.

But during the fall holiday, when the director, many of the staff and pupils 
were away, Harry suddenly disappeared. Then the next morning, someone had 
broken in to the control room of the school and barrricaded himself there. 
The gates of the school were closed, the phone connections broken, internet 
down.

A mysterous voice over the PA claimed to have abducted Harry, and threatened 
to kill him unless the demands were met. No police, no contact with the outside 
world. The pupils must fight each other until KO, and only the strongest will be 
allowed to fight for the life of Harry. Reluctantly, the remaining staff 
decide to meet the demands and allow the tournament to begin, until help 
can somehow be called. 

But what hidden conflicts will come to surface once the fighing starts, and are 
the pupils really willing to fight for one of their pers? Thus begins the 
Broken Hearts Battle!
