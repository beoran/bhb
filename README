Broken Hearts Battle, a lowpoly 3D fighting game and homage to Katawa Shoujo
===========================================================================

Introduction
------------

Broken Hearts Battle intends to become a free, open source lowpoly 3D fighting
game which feels somewhat like "Rival Schools", and is a homage to the visual
novel Katawa Shoujo (KS). The models will be made in Blender 2.6 or later. The
first version of the game will be programmed using the Blender Game Engine in
Python, so it will be portable to Windows, Linux and OS X.

Nothing much is there yet, but poke around in the various .blend files
using Blender to see what's going on.

After the I decided to scrap the initial "delinqient school" idea, I starteed thinking on the concept of "Fan Game". Then I decided tha in this fighting game,
the FANS of Katawa Shouyou will be the main characters.

Gameplay
--------

The game will use lowpoly 3d graphics, but with the fighting mostly on a
2D plane, in a somewhat "street fighter"-like style. There will be some
projectiles, but they are mostly annoyances, not hadokens! There will also be
no time-outs and no ring. Health is only restored after every duel, every fighter
has several (2, 3, 4) health bars that get depleted one by one, and they act
to divide the combat into "rounds". 

Every fighter also has a Rage/Focus bar that shifts between one of these two depending on play style. Button mashing moves ytyou to Rage, careful attacks
to Focus. Once either Rage or Focus is maxed, different special and super
attacks become possible, as well as a "Finishing Move". When the opponent's
health bar is almost depleted, a Finishing Move, if it connects, is an instant
KO.  Finishing moves are not possible if your health bar is also almost
depleted. The use of finishing moves influences the story of the game.

Help needed
-----------

*) Native english writer to clean up the story.
*) Artists for concept art and portraits.
*) Blender modellers. I will also model.
*) Suggestions for improving the setting and fleshing out the characters
and their fighting styles are always welcome. 
*) Beoran will do the programming, but help with programming is welcome too.


Story
-----

Katawas Shoujo is Visual novel that had become very popular within a certain
demography. People from all over the world flocked to the online forums of the
game to discuss it, and share their feelings and life stories.

One morning, a worrying message entitled "Stop Katawa Shoujo" appeared.
"I have abducted one of the members of Four Leaf Studios. If Kantawa Shoujo and
the forums are not taken offline in one month, you will never see him again."
At first, the message was thought to be a joke, but then it turned out that one
of the staff had disappeared for real, when a recordings of the member's voice
as well of his abductor'd demands was distributed to the media.

Some of the most ardent fans fans of Katawa Shoujo, appalled at this,
resolved to do whatever it takes, legal or not, to find and rescue the Four Leaf
Studio's member. Notwanting to trust the police, decided to join in real life
and find out what really happened. The nerds hacked away and were able to
pinpoint the area where the abductor must be living. Form all over the world,
the fans flocked to this place to find out the truth.

But suspicion is growing that it may very wel be one of the fans who is
responsible for this. And the fans themselves have their own difficult pasts,
and social anxieties, and wimpy physiques to deal with. Can they overcome their
differences, and their own problems and find out the truth?
