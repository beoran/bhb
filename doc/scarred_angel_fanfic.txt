Scarred Angel -- Part 1

I can see the sights of spring around while I ride my car. Some late blooming cherry blossom trees spread their pink branches to the sky . I see the dazzeling sunlight from the rising sun pour down on the hills. I slow down and park my car in the car park of Yamaku High. As I look at the school gates, suddenly I am overcome with memories of the past years. When I first came to this school, I was angry at myself, and angry at the world. But I met two people who reminded me what it was like to be loved. And I learned how to love them as well.

First I met Lily. She could not see my scars, so I found it a bit easier to talk to her than to other people. She was so unselfish, always placed other people's needs before her own. Yet, she did not see me as someone pitiable. I relied on her, but I could feel that often she relied on me too. While she seemed to have many friends, none of them seemed really close to her. I think that she was sometimes feeling... lonely. Yet she was always gently smiling, as if she did not have a problem in the world...

Yet one night, when had our usual evening tea party together. Lilly was sitting on the bed, when something unexpected happened. She accidentally let a tea cup slip from her fingers. The shards scattered over the floor. Then she suddenly started to cry. As her tears flowed out, told me her secrets, her sadness. How she missed her family and yet also felt upset at them. How there was no one she could rely on but her sister and me. How glad she was that I was there for her.

And over and over she said that she loved me. I held her in my arms, and not knowing how to comfort her. I kissed her, my lips trembling. First on her front, then on her cheeks, and then finally on her lips. And then I shyly confessed my feelings to her as well. Then she kissed me too. We laid down on the bed together. And we kissed, we hugged, we held each other tightly, arms and legs enwined. I did not feel strange or ashamed. I felt overcome with excitement, pleasure an joy. I was just happy to be with her. Even though I still hated myself, and could not let anyone else but her come close to me. I loved Lilly.

Then I met Hisao. But at first I was really afraid of him. But gently and shyly he entered my heart. I remember those tender days weher we would drink tea and play chess together. Already then I fell for him, even though I did not know him well. At first, our relationship was difficult becaue Hisao saw me as someone to protect. After I had a panic attack, and spent my birthday in my room, I could feel him slipping away from me. When he showed me his scar, I knew that I had to do something urgently. So I... decided to give him... eveything.

When I felt the time was right, I took him to my room. I showed him all of myself, and gave ... my body to him. We laid down on my bed together. He played with me, rubbed me, and ... entered in to me. I felt strange and ashamed. I felt overcome by pain, by sadness, by grief. But despite all that, I was happy to be with him. The next morning was awkward, but when we met later that day at the fountain, we told each other what was on our minds, and broke down in tears. Then I knew that Hisao and I finally had understood each other. We could finally open up and talk to each other honestly. And I kissed him for the first time. I loved Hisao.

What a beautiful summer it was, those days. We talked, we laughed, we kissed. Our love became stronger and stronger. But, there was a shadow over our happiness. Lilly was becoming more reserved. I knew that she did that out of consideration for Hisao and me. And of course, we did not spend any nights together in her bed anymore. Soon after that, Lilly was summoned by her family to go live with them overseas. Neither Hisao nor me wanted her to go, but she seemed determined to go back. She said wanted to go there for her parents's sake.

I though something felt strange about her leaving Japan, and Hisao though the same. Yet, we did nothing to convince her to say. The day after she left Yamaku, Hisao and I met and talked about Lilly. We both ended up crying in each other's arms. We both realised how much we would miss Lilly. Then, we decided we had to do something. We called a taxi and raced to the airport. What fooolish teenagers we were. Of course, we ended up in a terrible traffic jam. When we came to the airport, the airplane carrying Akira and Lilly had already left. The only thing we got out of it was a huge bill from the taxi company.

After Lilly arrived in Scotland, we did stay in touch by phone and by mail. There was some good news son after they left. Akira came back to Japan for a short time. Her boyfriend had agreed to go live with her in England. For legal reasons, they got married. They merely went to city hall to give in the wedding form and receive their wedding license, and Hisao and I siged as the witnesses. But Lilly did not come along with her sister. It's then that we realised Lilly was growing more distant from us.

Still, in her letters, Lily urged us to think about the future, to focus on our studies, and she would do the same. She had decided to become an English teacher and would go study at a prestigious English university. She was right of course, and Hisao and I too started thinking about our future. For Hisao, pretty soon it was clear that he wanted to become a science teacher. Also he decided to start working out and take better care of his health, so I would not have to worry too much about that.

I thought about my futire long and hard. While I like working alone, and I'm good with computers, I still felt worried about Hisao's condition. I wanted to be able to help him if his heart ever go him into problems. And not onnly him, I felt that I could become more confident if I could also help other people. So I decided to become a nurse.

Of course, we would have to go to different niversities, so I was worried that Hisao and I would grow distant from each other, and that I would also loose my other friend, my other love. However, on the day of the graduation, after I had received my diploma, he took me back to the tea room where we had spent so much time together, kneeled, and asked me to marry him. I was overjoyed, and of course, I accepted.

Like that we were engaged, but we decided to postphone our wedding until we both graduated. And we aslo postponed our ... wedding night. We loved each other and enjoyed hugging and kissing each other. But that time in my room was the only time we did... that. Hisao still felt somewhat ashamed for the way he went at it. I hadn't had the courage to show myself again to him like that. So we promised to wait until we both had grown up, until he had become my husband, and I had become his wife.

We started our studies, and the years crawled by. In the beginning studying to be a nurse was hard on me. I had to bind up my hair, so my scars were plain in sight to eveybody. Sometimes, I had to hide in the linnen room and call Hisao on the phone whan I felt a panic attack coming. Sometimes I was bullied by some of the other students who felt I didn't belong.

When I started my internship in the burns ward, some patients didn't want to have anything to do with me. But there were also patients, usually those in a dire siuation, who found it easier to talk to me than to anyone else of the medical staff. It was probably because they because they felt I would understand their situation better. Soon, people started calling me the "Scarred Angel". The bullying stopped. Finally, my colleagues respected me, but I felt they also somewhat feared me...

My light in those dificult days was Hisao. I called him every day, and whenever I felt I could not stand it anymore. We met each other in the holidays, talking, holding hands, kissing, hugging. He too found it hard to live without me. He told me of his loneliness and his desire for me. And I too I could feel evey time, I longed for him more and more. It's true that absence makes the loving heart go fonder. Yet, we persevered. We kept going at our studies, and stuck to our promise.

It's a lie that time heals all wounds. I kept in touch with Lilly, but by then, I only sent a letter every three months and called her just as sporadically. I heard that her english studies were going well, she didn't seem to want to talk about personal matters anymore. I was sad at this. The longer she was away from me the more I missed her. I could not believe that she had abandoned me.

When I talked about Lilly to Hisao, he told me he also missed her. He thought he also believed that Lilly probably had her own rasons, since she would never truly abandon her friends. I know it was unreasonable, but such thoughts kept me believing in Lilly. Even against all hope, I kept on loving her, even though there seemed to be no way she would return to me.

And then, this year, we both finally graduated. Hisao and I decided that we'd like to go place where we could both find work. But after looking for months, we were unable to find anything suitable. Then out of the blue, Shizune contacted me. She had not gone to college, but started her own buiness after graduating from high school. In the time it took for us to graduate, she had already become a millionaire, and a benefactor of Yamaku. She had heard I and Hisao had graduated, and wanted to so something to make up for the clumsy way she'd been meddling with our lives while we were in high school.

At first, I thought she had taken pity on me, and I didn't want her to pull strings on our behalf. But she told me I had it wrong. Nurse was going to leave the school and go work at a research hospital. So the school needed a new nurse. And the school had expanded due to her generous donations, so they needed an extra science teacher as well. Shizune thought it would be best if two ex-Yamaku students accepted these positons, and that's why she had tried to contact me. My heart jumped at those words. Finally Hisao and I would be able to work together, live together, and get married. So after I talked with Hisao, we both accepted to come back to work at Yamaku High.

I walk though the gate. Today is the day when the teachers come back from their holidays, and start preparing for the new school year. That is still one wek off though, so the school grounds are still mostly abandoned. When I enter the nurse's office, Nurse is there, waiting for me with the same grin he had so many years ago. We greet with a bow, but there is no time for small talk. We immediately start to disscus the job, the students, and the cases I will have to take care of. It's already near lunch time when he finishes his explanations. "That should be enough to get you started. I'm glad to se you have grown ito such a fine woman. I trust you will be able to handle this, but call me on this number whenever there is something you want to ask me." he says.

"What about today's appointments?" I ask. "Since today is your first day, I have to instruct you properly during the whole day. So I cancelled the few appointments there were. I asked them not to come unless there is an emergency. And also, you don't have to go introduce yourself to your colleagues yet So please take it easy for today." he says. "Oh, you should not have!" I bow in thanks. "No, it's nothing. I wouldn't want to wear you out on your first day at work. Besides I think someone you want to meet who will be coming here soon." He winks. "Y-Yes, thank you very much." My face colors red, and I bow again more deeply. He simply bows back and leaves without another word, grinning even wider.

I shift though the files, rereading them, but I can't focus very well... Hisao. I feel like I am getting excited just thinking about him. It's true, I have become a woman now. Often I long for Hisao, I want him to be with me and... Now, it's even worse because we haven't met in a month or so. We want to build a house to go live together once we get married, but we decided to live separately for now until the big day. Like that, we will not be tempted to break our promise...

I cover my scar with my hand in embarassment, as I feel my head getting completely red... No, not like this! I must be serious on my first day at work! I can't be dreaming about such things! And also Hisao... he should be here any minute now. Today he is also starting here as a science teacher. Mutou must by now have finished lecturing him on the fine details of his work. I smile a bit at the tought. Then I hear a knock on the door. My heart skips a beat.

"C-come in!" I say. Slowly the door opens, and a blonde lady with a cane steps in. She closes the door behind herself. "I heard the school has a new nurse, I though I'd pass by to introduce myself." Lilly says as she elegantly bows deeply. "I am Lilly Satou, and I will be the new English teacher. I hope you will take good care of me." "L-Lilly!!? L-Lilly" I shout as I jump up from my chair. "H-How? W-Why?" I say as I start crying.

"Hanako!? Is that you!? Then.. Shizune! She must have..?" Lilly starts crying too. It takes a few moments before she collects herself. "Well, I think I have to apologise to you, Hanako. I do owe you an explanation." she says, with a sad smile on her face. Then, there is another knock on the door. "Hisao?!" I shout! "Yes, Hanako, can I come in?"

No, not now! Not like this. I can't... "Lilly, please follow me and lie down here. We can't ... let him know just yet." I whisper. Lilly looks puzzled for an instant, but then nods quietly. I put her down on the bed and close the curtain. Then I walk over to the door. "I'm sorry H-Hisao, I-Ihaveapatienttotakecareof!"
"Oh," "I hear for behind the door? I see! Well, then I'll come back this afternooon after class is over." "O-Ok" I reply. Then I hear his footsteps walk away, and I sigh in relief.

I walk back to the bed and open the curtain. Lilly sits up and I go sit next to her. "Well, at least now I will have a lot of time for that explanation." she says and smiles a bit sadly. And I start crying again.


Scarred Angel -- Part 2

I can hear the sounds of spring around me as I ride the bus. The singing birds joined with the the gurgle of the engine. I feel warm sunlight on my face. I smell pugnant exhaust fumes, mixed with the sweet and floral scents of the season. As the bus rocks me though and fro, I start to reminisce on the path that has taken me here. The path that now will finally return me to Yamaku High.

When I first came to this school, I though it was the best possible arrangement for my sister and my family. I did not want anyone to worry about me. I never had a thought about my own needs. But in this school, I met people who taught me that I also have my own feelings and desires. And I learned how to love others  sincerely.

First I encountered Hanako. When I adressed her, her shy voice trembled in reply. But soon, we were talking to each other every day. She allowed me to touch her face, on which the scars of the past still remained. I knew many people in Yamaku and was friendly to all of them. But I felt I could not confide in anyone, except my sister. And her work kept her occupied so there were not much times we could really talk. Hanako was not someone who liked other people, but I felt she was fiercely loyal to me. I knew that I could tell her what was on my mind. 

Still, I did not want to trouble her too much. I wanted to support her as a friend ought to. But I had to move to the Yamaku dorms, giving me even less chance to meet Akira. The student council came tumbling down on me due to Shizune's obstinacy. I missed my parents, but in the darkest recesses of my mind, I felt a repressed discontent, an anger. Were Akira and I nothing but inconveniences to them? Nothing but pawns on the chessboard of business? But I could not think like that for long. I convinced myself that it would be a difficult udertaking for mt family to take care of someone like me. So I resolved to be strong. I could take care of myself, and no one would have to worry about me.

It was a lie. I don't know why that cup slipped from my fingers, but as it crashed, I realised it. I was lying to myself and I started to weep.  I felt emarassed to touble Hanako so much, but she came to me and comforted me. My mouth started whispering, speaking, shouting, and could not stop overflowing with the song that my heart was full of. Then, Hanako's trembling lips shyly pressed on mine. I could no longer reign in my own passions. Dear God, please forgive me for what I did that night! I felt strange and ashamed. But, I was overcome with excitement, pleasure and joy. I was just happy to be with her. I loved Hanako.

Then I met Hisao. While he was also a timid boy, I could sense right away he was a very kind soul. He spent a lot of time with Hanako and me. I enjoyed his company, as did  Hanako. Soon, I felt that the two of them had fallen in love with each other, without themselves even noticing it. 

Dear God, I though then You were so good to me, to punish me so lightly! Hanako would have a chance at a happy life, a happy love with Hisao. And I would become their friend, to support them. I accepted Your punishment with all my heart. I swore to You that I would do all in my power to make sure that Hisao and Hanako would be happy together. I knew I could not interfere direcly, but with my sisters's help I was able to bring them closer. One day when Hanako wasn't there, I even slipped some protection into Hisao's pocket.

Dear God, I know You may not approve of such tactics, but I knew Hisao was a serious boy. I felt that if he made love to Hanako, he would most likely stay with her and marry her. Then Hanako would live a happy life with Hisao. At least, that is how I lied to myself. I was such a sinful girl... Alone, in bed, I would often think about Hanako, and the things we did that night. And also about Hisao... and how I wanted him to also do such things to me!

I do not know how such a thing was possible. I loved Hanako, and wanted to be with her. But I also wanted to take her place and be the one who Hisao loved, the one he would make love too. I imagined that if I told Hanako and Hisao about my feelings for both of them, then the three of us could live together, as lovers. But I knew such a thing is against all decency and common sense. So I staid quiet and determined to keep my oath. Still, I loved Hisao.

I was a bit worried when I visited my family in Scotland. I could not be there when Hanako's birthday was coming up. I woried that there would be problems between her and Hisao. Then I finally met my faily again. I was happy to meet them and yet... something was bothering me. Then it turned out they were summoning Akira and me to come live with them. 

Dear God, then I thought that I was haughty to think that my punishment would be a light one. Even when I had promised to atone, I kept on sinning with my selfish desires. I knew that eventually I would not be able to control my passions. If I staid in Japan I would end up doing something that would break them apart. So, I decided to accept my family's summons and go live overseas. I would take care of my parents. Even if it ment I would have to live far away from the two people I loved the most. I accepted it all as my just punishment.

Soon after I returned to Yamaku, I heard good new. Hanako and Hisao had become girlfriend and boyfriend. I was truly happy when I heard that, and yet, I was sad since I knew that my role as mediator had come to an end. I told them that I would return to Scotland. They tried to talk me out of it but I remained adamant. I could not tell them, but I would only be a burden on their future happiness.

Then, not long before before I left Yamaku, I met Hisao by chance. It was outside in the school's grounds. It must already have been dark because I felt the chill of the evening breeze on my skin and smelt the smells of the night. Hisao begged me to think of myself, and of my on happiness. He had understood that going to Scotland was not what I really wanted. I broke down in tears, and he softly hugged me, to comfort me.... And then, feeling his warmth against me, and his manly smells.... my passion woke again. I took his face in my hands, felt his lips, and kissed him, long and pasionately... 

Then I broke his embrace, and shouted at him that I loved him. And that I loved Hanako too, in the same way. And that that was the reason why I had to leave. I would break their happiess if I stayed. I begged him to take good care of Hanako, and to forget about me, to forget about that kiss too. I implored him to never mention it to Hanako or anyone else, I implored him to let me go and not follow me. And I ran off, stumbling, falling and standing again, soiling and scrating my hands, until I made it back to my room. I wept, but I told Hisao the truth. He loved Hanako, so he would understand that there was no other way.

And then I left, and went to live with my family. When I heard about the failed stunt that Hanako and Hisao had pulled, I wondered why they did such a thing, but I also felt relieved that they hadn't made it. For if they had, I would probably have lost my resolve. 

Akira, though, felt impressed. She realised that she could not live without her boyfriend. Against my parents whishes, she went back to Japan to marry him, and took him with her to Scotland. She was worried about me too, and I think she had expected me to come along with her. But I refused because I knew what wouldhappen... I asked Hidao and Lilly to focus on their future, and I decided to do the same. 

After I graduated high school, I went to study English. I heard from Shizune that Hisao and Hanako had gotten engaged. I felt relieved and happy for them. At least, that's what I though then. But still, I missed them, both of them. Akira and her husband tried to cheer me up as much as possible. But I could not be completely honest to them. It must have been obvious that I was having problems adapting to my new life. 

Slowly the years passed by. I kept in touch with Hanako and Hisao, but I still felt like inruding on them. I ended up only writing them and called them at their birthdays or similar occasions. In college, I was well liked, and made many new acquiantances. But I kept them at an arm's length. I could not forget my two loves. In my dreams,  I could still hear their voices, smell their smells, and feel their caresses. Dreams of guilt, love and desire.

Finally I graduated from university. On the day I returned home, my parents were waiting for me. But they were not alone. They wanted to introduce me to my future husband... I knew this man since he had gone to same college as me. He was the son of a wealthy business partner of my father's. I guess he was interested in me, but he was... everything I hated in a man. For four years I had managed to kep him at bay, but it seemed that he now had gone for a more backhanded approach. 

I realised that it was true what Akira had told me som any times. Our parents loved us, but when it came to it, that love was much like how a chess player loves his queen. She remains a piece to be used and even sacrificed in the game to ensure the player's victory. I deperately dashed out of my parent's house, and called my sister, begging me to get me out of there. My parents came after me and tried to persuade me, but I did not listen to them, not this time. I now clearly remembered why I was angry at them, and why I had to leave them.




8:6 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame. 





Then, they introduced me to John ...

John was related to one of my father's business contacts. He was a theology student set to become a rector. John was a kindly man, who treated me in a respectful and gentlemanly way. At first, I did not know very well how to behave when I was together with him. But he kept on showering me with his affection, yet he was never overbearing or condescending. He always supported me, even though I always refused to tell him what was troubling me. 

This During my years in college, he was there to support me when I felt sad or lonely. 

, after graduating, he knelt down and ggave me his r
Soon I started thinking that God given a second chance in life. I would have a normal love,  and have John's children. My sins were forgiven. 
















"Next stop, Yamaku High." the bus driver says helpfully. Today is my first day at work. It is also the day when I will finally meet 













"I am sorry for not telling you earlier, Hanako, I wan't even sure myself that I should do this. For all these years, I tried. I tried to live with my family, I tried to live in Scotland, I tried to tell myself I was happy there. But I was not. I barely knew my parents anymore, I was surronded by a culture I didn't know well and didn't undersatnd and most of all, I missed my friends. After I graduated, I was at a loss"

















One good thing we learned was that Akira had asked her boyfriend for forgiveness, and she got married to him so he could 











 
I love Lilly and Hisao very much. 

I love Hanako and Hisao very much.




I told Hisao again how much I loved Lilly. And then Hidao admitted that he loved Lilly too... 

Now, a normal woman, would be apalled at such words. A normal woman would be jealous, scared, angry, I don't know.... But I... I felt happy! What a depraved , strange, and twisted woman I must be. I didn't care about that then. It felt all right. We both loved the same person, and we loved each other.
