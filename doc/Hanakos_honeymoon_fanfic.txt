Well, here'a little Hanako story I wanted to tell for a while... more should be coming later. Hope you can enjoy it. :)

Part 1 - Flight 

I feel a bit excited as the plane takes off from the Narita runway. Trough the window on my right hand side I see the ground getting farther and farther away until we break though the clouds. Hisao is sitting slumped backwards in his seat, gazing wearily in front of him. He was working late correcting exams yesterday, and we had to wake up early in the morning to make it to airport in time. I touch his arm and smile lightly to him to try and cheer him up.

"Hisao, isn’t it wonderful! I feel like our life together has finally begun!" I say
"Yes, it’s great, Hanako, it’s great. But I had hoped to be in a better shape..." he says as he yawns widely.
"Y-you are working very hard. So please relax a bit now. We can enjoy together once we have arrived." I say.
"I think I will do that. I’ll take a nap if you don’t mind." he says.
"Please, do so" I say.

He nods, pushes his seat backwards and closes his eyes. In less than a minute he’s already dozed off. Teachers are just as busy as regular employees. They have to correct homework, tests and exams, and prepare for class every day. Hisao's a science teacher now. And he’s just started in that school, so he has to work hard to prove himself. In the evenings, he’s often worn down. But I wish...

We’ve reached cruising altitude and the the entertainment system turns on. I don’t feel tired yet, so maybe I should play a game? Or watch a movie? "Sex and the city"... hmm, the other movies look boring, so I guess I’ll just watch this one... This is interesting! I focus on the screen, and barely notice the stewardess who passes by for drink service. I don’t take my eyes off the screen as I lower my table, and put the pretzels, my glass of wine and Hisao’s can of beer on it. I keep on watching, engrossed until the credits roll.

I take off my earphones. Those ladies in the movie.. they really seem happy... Carry has some problems, but finally gets married to her Mr. Big. Even Charlotte has ...sex with her husband three times per week... And Samantha seems to enjoy it a lot, even with her boyfriend... I wish I could also... I take a glance at Hisao...

I frown. It wasn’t very nice of Miranda though not to have sex with her husband for three months... Five months... it’s five moths ago since we... Samantha left her boyfriend in the movie because she wasn’t happy with his .. performance. But I could never do that! I would never throw Hisao away! But still...

I know he’s very busy with his work. And it’s been hectic even from before we got married. We had to find an apartment, choose furniture, arrange the rooms. We wanted a simple wedding party, but so many people from Yamaku and university came, that at the end of the day Hisao was so tired from entertaining the guests that we also didn’t...

"Come on, keep your chin up", I whisper to myself. This is our honeymoon! Hisao can relax first, and then we will be able to ... have fun ... perhaps even two or three times per day. "Three times per day, ...that’s twenty one times!" I think hopefully.

Suddenly I remember something I’d rather not. I sigh dejectedly. Twenty three times. In the six years we are together we only did that... twenty three times... I don’t know what makes me most sad, that it was so few, or that I can actually remember how many times it was. Of course, after Yamaku, we went to different universities, so we couldn’t meet very often. And we where both very busy after graduating to find a job. But still...

I remember how awkward the first time was. But now we are more experienced, and I really enjoy being together with Hisao like that. And Hisao also always looks like he is enjoying himself as well, and that makes me happy. But he never shows much initiative. I always have to drag him off to a room and strip before he understood what I want. So I worry... maybe I’m not very exciting to him?

I really feel I need Hisao, I'm very much attracted to him physically as well. Even before I met him, I would do... something myself, sometimes, when I was lying alone in bed. It was the only thing that comforted me a little when I was in tears. I still felt lonely, but I could relax and I felt like some of my stress was relieved. No, not sometimes, I must be honest to myself... more like every day! But then, I was alone, and a virgin, so I didn’t know what it was like to be with a man. But now I know and ... doing something alone just isn’t the same at all. I need Hisao... badly! Of if only I could just ask him... just say those shameful words...

I squeeze my eyes closed and put my hands up as if praying.
"Please fuck me!" Oh, no I didn’t intend that to come out out loud! Actually, I even shout a bit! I look up at the startled stewardess who just asked me what I’d like for dinner...
"S-sorry! I mean..., eh, f-fish for me and m-meat for my h-husband, P-PLEASE!" I shout even louder.
She blinks once and then lowers Hisao’s table, puts my dinner on my table and Hisao’s on his. Then she leaves with a curious smile on her face. Hisao slowly wakes up from my shouting.
"Oh, it’s already dinner time?" he says.
"You had a nice nap? I ordered the meat for you because you were asleep." I say.
"Oh thank you, I’ll tuck in right away" he smiles.

And with that our conversation is over as soon as it starts. So I take out my fork and knife and start eating the dinner as well. I finish eating the main course and I take out the chocolate dessert. But my mind wanders off again. With the spoon in my mouth, I suddenly imagine putting Hisao's ... thing in there... No! It’s not going to work out well if it stays like this between Hisao and me! But I must not give up! After all those problems I had before, these should be the happiest days of my life! Just like before, I’ll hang in there and find a way to solve this problem as well!

Part 2 - Landing 

I empty my second glass of wine. I see Hisao's beer can is also empty. Everyone is about done with dinner now. The stewardesses busily pass by to pick up the garbage. They turn off the lights inside the airplane. Most people simply lean back and go to sleep. Hisao tells me he'll be gone for a while and goes to the toilets.

The stewardess passes by, sees that I'm still awake, and suddenly talks to me. "Japanese passengers are easy to take care of. We just turn off the lights and they fall asleep." she says.
"Ah y-yes, that must be e-easy." I say.
"Almost everyone is asleep now, so I'm sure nobody would notice if you ... went to help your husband." she says with a wink, then walks away. I can't believe what I just heard! These foreign ladies are so ... bold! And that even a stewardess would encourage me...

I think about Hisao in the toilets. I could go in there and then... yes! But what if someone sees me go in? Or what if someone hears me? It would be so embarrassing! But still, I feel like I'm going to explode!
"Father, mother, give me courage!", I pray silently. I stand up from my seat, and walk to the door. Suddenly the door opens and Hisao steps out.
"Ah, you also have to go?" he says.
"Y-yes, but..." I say
"I'll head back then. We have to be careful no one steals our stuff." he says.

Disappointing! I just nod as Hisao walks back to the seat. I enter the toilet, take off my skirt and panties and sit down. I finish peeing and take a piece of paper to wipe. I notice it's quite hard and slick... My finger slides over my sensitive spot. No, no, not now! Ah, but... why cant I stop my hand from moving!? I start rubbing, and I silently count my strokes. Already at nineteen... I have to stifle a yelp as I come. Then I sigh. That was really too much...

Disappointed again, I stand up, put my clothes on, and head back. Hisao lets me slip in my seat and gives me a smile. He doesn't seem to notice my flush.
"It's a very long flight isn't it." he says. I just nod.
"But I don't mind because I get to spend every hour of it with you." he says. I smile back at him.
"I feel the same as you, Hisao.", and I give him a quick peck on the cheek. I feel happy, but I just want a bit more... Still, I can't seem to find a way to tell him about my needs.

He raises his eyebrows and turns to the small screen in front of him.
"Let's see what movies are on this thing." he says.
"Sex and the City" I blurt out. Hisao looks a bit startled.
"I-I mean, it's a fun movie. I just watched it, I think you will like it too." I say.
"Oh, I see, I'll watch it then." he says. He turns on the screen and starts watching the movie. It's a long flight indeed. The plane gently rocks trough and fro. The wine is getting to me, and I feel tired after relieving myself. I close my eyes for a moment...

"Please perpare for landing." the voice of the pilot over the PA system wakes me with a start.
Hisao sit next to me, awake "Good morning!" he says. "I watched that movie, but I couldn't sleep well, I already slept too much before...". He yawns a bit. "But you seemed to be sleeping very well. You looked very cute." he smiles tiredly.
"So you do like watching sleeping girls, Hisao?" I joke.
"Only you!" he says.

After that, the happy mood evaporates, and I just stare in front of me as the plane descends. We're shaken a bit as the airplane lands on the tarmac. Hisao and I take our belongings, and make our way out of the plane, past the immigration inspection, to the luggage pickup. We take our luggage, leave the airport and hop into a taxi. Today the highway is not very busy, so after a short ride we arrive at our destination. We pay the driver, get our luggage and enter the hotel. The clerk checks our reservation and hands us the key of the honeymoon suite with a smile.

We ride the elevator up, and just out of the top floor, is the door of the suite. Hisao unlocks it and opens it gallantly for me.
"Oh, how nice of you!" I say pleasantly surprised.
"I read a bit about European culture." he says. "It seems here it's polite to open a door for a lady."
With a smile, I pull the suitcase behind me and walk in. Hisao follows, closes the door and walks to the bathroom right away.
"I feel a bit sweaty from the plane, so if you don't mind I'll take a quick shower." he says.
"Oh, certainly, please take a shower." I answer.

I open the suitcases and I can hear running water in the bathroom. I unpack the essentials and set the suitcases aside. Maybe the water will perk Hisao right up? I quickly take some underwear with me, and head over to the bathroom. I see Hisao stand in the shower, his shoulders a bit slumped.
"I'm sorry Hanako, I'm still tired from the flight". Frustrated I slap my face with my hand.
"Are you ok?" he asks.
"I-I'm f-fine, .. please relax, Hisao. Don't wory, I'll take care of unpacking." "Thank you, Hanako, you're really a very caring wife." he says and walks out of the bathroom. I can hear him lie down on the bed.

"Thank you Hisao", I sigh. Hisao is a nice husband. He's very kind, honest and reliable. I want to be a good wife for him. But sometimes I wish he was a naughty boy and I his bad girl... It looks like today too ... that won't happen...


( Research notes: The Galler shop is on 114, boulevard Haussmann paris. 
I'll asssume that they have a hotel near Saint Augustain metro station, perhaps
the Best Western Premier Opera Diamond 4, rue de la Pépinière, Champs-Élysées, 
75008 Paris, since it would be plausible to pass by the chocolate shop on the
way to the metro station like that, and the hotel is 4 star and sufficently
luxurious.)


Part 3 -- Eylsium

Hisao is taking a nap on the bed. I finish unpacking and start reading the tourist guide we've brought. With small sticky paper markers we have marked the places we would like to visit. Many Japanese couples go on honeymoon in Hawaii. But I can't very well go on the beach or for a swim. Though I fell less self-conscious about the scars on my face, and I don't wear a cap anymore when I go out, I still don't want anyone but Hisao to see those on my body. And I don't like the heat, it makes my skin pull.

So we decided to go to old Europe, to one the most romantic city on earth. Paris! As I page though the book, I notice one place that catches my attention... if I go there, maybe I can finally gather the courage to talk to Hisao and be honest about what I want. I know it's difficult for us. We're both not very comfortable to talk about the subject. And in Japan, there are many married couples who have such a problem. 

"Sexless" they call it... I shudder at the thought. I don't want that to happen to Hisao and me! I'm sorry Hisao, your heart must cause you problems... And with my body like that it must be hard for you to get excited about me... Maybe, I have be more sexy myself? Usually, I just take my clothes off and then let him do all the work... Maybe that's why Hisao is getting bored of me?

I look ahead of me at the TV screen. I suddenly realize that this is a hotel, so they may have that kind of channel... I turn on the TV, turn the volume down, and after a bit of zapping I find the channel I was looking for. This European stuff is really explicit! They don't even put a raster over it!

But I never watched this kind of stuff before, so I'm a bit surprised to see how they go at it. I cock my head to the side in amazement. She's licking him, and then takes his ...thing completely inside her mouth... Can you really do that? Then, she sits on top of him taking his ...thing, inside her... I watch with my mouth agape as I see her riding him.

"What time is it now?" Hisao says. I look at him as he sits up, and he looks looks at me. Or rather he looks past me, at the screen, with amazement rising on his face. I blush, quickly turn around and switch off the TV.
"D-did you sleep well?" I say as I look on my watch.
"I-It's half past one in the afternoon." I say.
Hisao doesn't ask anything about what he saw, for which I'm grateful.
"Yes, thanks, Hanako. But looks like we'll be too late for lunch. We should go out now and see if we can't find a nice place." he says.
"A-ah, yes, of course." I say.

He gets up. We get ready and head out. But there doesn't seem to be any interesting restaurants around.
"Hisao, I want to see the Champs Elisees... there must be some nice restaurants there. L-let's walk to the metro station. I think I know the way." I say.
"Hanako, that's a good idea." We walk along the lane past a Starbucks, but I'm not really interested, we have those in Japan too. Then after walking about five minutes we cross the street and turn the corner.
"There's the metro entrance!" Hisao points out as he paces over to the stairs. But my eye catches the window of a small white shop. "Galler" is written above it.

"W-wait, Hisao!" I say as I look longingly at the delicious items. Hisao also notices the shop.
"Ah yes, you love those, don't you? And we have to buy travel presents too, so let's take a look inside!" he says. He's right. When we come back to Japan our colleagues, friend and Hisao's family will expect us to bring back some presents for them. So we buy a dozen of small boxes as gifts. And I get one big box and six bars for myself. The shop clerk helpfully packs it all in a big paper bag.
"Should I bring these back to the hotel?" Hisao asks helpfully. "I'd rather not go back, Hisao, and the weather's not very hot. Let's go in the metro." I say.

We head down, as Hisao carries the bag. We ride the metro and get out at the George V station. We head up and find ourselves in the middle of the famous street, just next to the Lido. We start walking toward the Triumph Arch. Although we see a few fancy restaurants, the menus doesn't have any photos, and neither of us understand any French. I'm really getting hungry now, so when I see a local hamburger restaurant, I beckon Hisao over and we go inside. We manage to order by pointing at the photos in the shop. We go sit down at a tiny table in a quiet corner, facing each other.

I take a bite from my fish burger and Hisao nibbles on his beef burger.
"Well, I should eat healthier food than this." he smiles. I bow my head.
"Hisao, I-I'm sorry if don't like it. I c-couldn't wait anymore. I j-just had to eat something!" I apologize.
"Hanako, please don't apologize." he says as smiles. "I'm sorry I didn't tell you before, but I actually like fast food. And I love hamburgers. But I can only eat them occasionally for ... you know." 

Relieved I straighten myself and smile back at him.
"I never knew... Thank you for telling me." And with that we continue eating our lunch.  I slurp my drink with a straw and I notice that behind Hisao's back, a young couple are kissing each other. On the mouth, with their tongues fooling around! And they keep going on and on, just where everyone can see them! I space out a bit as imagine Hisao and me doing the same...

"Hanako, You OK?" he says. Startled, I squirt some cola all over Hisao's face.
"Ah, sorry, .. I was just..." I stutter.
"No, I'm sorry to startle you." Hisao says as he wipes his face with a napkin. I embarrassedly gaze at him, and cover my face with my hand. But Hisao just breaks out in laughter. Seeing the silliness of the situation soon I start giggling together with him.

"Another good memory for us, huh?" he says.
"Y-yes, another good memory. And like this it's even better." I say. And I give him a quick kiss on his lips. They still taste like cola, so I giggle again.
"Anyway, let's go see the Triumph Arc!" I say. We finish our lunch, thow away the garbage and leave. And we start walking up to the Arc, hand in hand.

Just being together with Hisao makes me happy. I feel he relies on me and trusts me like no one else. I feel that I am deeply connected to him. Even though it's for me hard to open up to him sometimes. I must become more brave. Surely, soon, I'll be able to tell him!

. 
Part 4 - Concord

I hand my camera to an old man and let him take a picture of us with the Triumph Arch in behind us. He returns it to me with a friendly hand wave and I bow to him in thanks. We cross the street, pay for entrance, and climb the stairs up to the top. We get a lovely view of the surroundings as the gentle sun pours down it's warm rays on the city. In the distance, I see the Eiffel tower.

I point it out to Hisao.
"Impressive, isn't it?" I say. It does remind me of ... something. I take a breath.
"Yes it is." he says.
"From here, it looks a bit like like a p-penis, huh?" ...There, I said it!
"Well, now you mention it, yes it does... it's even a bit thicker at the top." Hisao says.
"Mine is a lot smaller though, it's not so impressive, I guess" Hisao says with a look of regret on his face. Oh no, I didn't know he was self-conscious about his! It's true that Hisao isn't... that big, but...
"I-- It's fine Hisao, you are plenty big enough!" I say apologetically.
"That's a relief to hear." he says with a smirk. I understand now, he was joking!
"D-don't make me worry like that." I laugh out loud and punch him gently in the arm.
"Ow!" He says with a mock pained face, then he also laughs.

Well, that went well. The mood's not right now, though, so I'll have to talk more seriously later. We walk down the stairs and stand under the Arch.
"Where you want to go next?" Hisao asks.
"I want to take a look at the shops!" I say. I take his hand and we stroll back to the Champs Elisees. We pass by many shops and I stop many times, gazing at all the lovely items on display. Vuitton, Dolce&Gabanna, Lacoste, ... all the famous brands have a shop on this street. Hisao offers to buy an expensive hand bag for me but I decline. His teacher's salary is not that high, and besides I prefer just to windowshop with Hisao by my side.

We continue along the road. I'm getting thirsty, so we go sit down on the terrace of the cafe. We order tea. From my purse I pass Hisao a little box with his daily ration of pills, which he swallows dutifully. Then he goes to the toilet. While he's away, I also take my pill. They are not very popular in Japan yet, but it regulates my flow, and I want to us to have fun together without worrying about protection. When Hisao's back, I head to the toilets too. Not today, I think, I have to keep my energy for this evening!

When I return, I read the guide book a bit more. I can find a tasty looking restaurant for dinner. But it's a bit far, so we'll probably have to take the metro to go there. And it's a bit too early for dinner yet.
"Why don't we take a long walk up to there?" Hisao says as he points to the map.
"All the way up to the Place de la Concorde? That's quite far... Will you be OK?". I worry.
"I'll be fine. You know I've been exercising in the morning. And this will be a good exercise too." he says. So we pay, get up and start walking again. All the time Hisao gallantly carries the big paper bag for me as I holds his other hand.

I enjoy the sun, the trees, the parks, and after half an hour or so we find ourselves on the Place de la Concorde. Hisao points to the column in the middle of the square.
"Do you think that also looks like a penis?" Hisao grins.
"Y-Yes." I smile at his joke. "There are so many of them here..." I joke.
"Maybe that's why they say Paris is the city of love?" he says. We both break out in laughter again. I turn to Hisao, and take his face between my hands.
"And I love you Hisao..." I kiss him on his lips, intensely, and lick his lips with my tongue. "Hanako..." he whispers and flusters as I break away. Slightly embarrassed, he rubs the back of his head. But then he smiles again.

"Well, this IS the city of love, so...." he says. He steps forward, lifts my chin up with his free hand, and returns my kiss. He even pushes his tongue in my mouth for just a second. Yes! Like that, Hisao, please! Then he breaks away again.
"I love you Hanako!" he says as he looks me in the eyes.
"That's what they call a "F-French Kiss", right?" I giggle.
"Yes, I think so." Hisao smiles back.
"Since we are in F-France, let's a-always kiss like that." I say and blush a bit.
"Well, it would be embarrassing if we did that in Japan, but here... it will be OK. So, it's a promise!" he says with a solemn nod.
"It's a promise." I nod back.

The restaurant is actually not far from the Place de la Concorde. So we decide to keep on walking through the Tuilleries Garden. We sit down there for a few minutes so Hisao can catch his breath. I enjoy the view of the shrubs and trees. Then we go on to the Garden of the Royal palace, where we can see the restaurant. We enter, and an older man in a waiter's uniform greets us. With a look at the rings on our fingers and an understanding smile, he leads us to a small table in a discreet corner. I take out the guide book again. It has a Japanese menu for this restaurant, and small photos of the dishes available here. With them we're able to point out our order. It's our honeymoon after all, so we both decide to have the lobster. With a bottle of white wine to go with it.

The waiter gets the wine and lets Hisao taste it. Hisao approves it with a nod. The waiter then fills my glass and Hisao's and retreats to the kitchen. I put my hand left on top of the table, and Hisao puts his hand on top of mine. A little candle flickers in a vase between us. I enjoy the mood and just stare into Hisao's eyes, and quietly sip at my wine from time to time, until the waiter comes back and announces that our meal is ready with a respectful <Pardonnez-moi>. He puts the large plate with lobster in front of me, then he goes and returns again for Hisao's.

We both tuck in, and I savor the delicious lobster. Hisao breaks a part off and noisily slurps the meat out of the shell.
"You know, it's not polite to slurp in Europe!" I chide him half-jokingly.
"Now you mention it, I remember reading something like that." he says, "but it must be hard to drink hot soup without slurping though." he ponders.
"That's why they blow on their soup here." I tell him.
"Blowing? How is that any more polite than slurping?" he says.
"It's just a cultural difference, I guess". I say.

Slurping, blowing... I'm reminded of what I saw on TV a few hours ago. A cultural difference... maybe that will excite Hisao?
"Hanako?" Hisao suddenly says.
Surprised, I spill some wine over my lobster. My hand has stopped in mid air, holding the wine glass.
"I'm f-fine, I just z-zoned out a bit."
"You seem a bit distracted today." Hisao wories.
"N-no, it's not that, I enjoy being with you so much I'm over the moon." I say and I put the wine glass down.

Well, it's not a lie! The mood is so romantic. I look into Hisao's eyes, and again I am flooded with happiness. In this moment, everything is all right and everything is perfect. Finally I feel, I can forgive myself.
"Hisao, I love you so much, more than words can say..." I say.
"I love you, I love you!" I whisper as warm tears roll down my face.

Wordlessly I pray in my own mind. Father, mother, thank you so much for saving my life! You sacrificed everything, but all I did was blame myself. But now, I am grateful for what you did for me. You must be happy too to see my life turned out so well. I promise I will never be bitter again! ... But still ... still there is one thing... I know I am selfish and lewd ... but will you please grant me my wish? Will you guide me tonight, if only so you can have grandchildren later?

I notice Hisao looking at me with concern.
"And these tears, these are tears of happiness!" I say. Hisao wipes my tears away with his handkerchief, and kisses it.
"Then I will take good care of them." he says with a sincere face.
"Because, here and now, with you, is the happiest moment of my life." he says as he closes his eyes. A few tear flow down from his eyes as well. I take his hand again, and squeeze it, and we both lean over the table. I close my eyes too, our tongues lock in a deep, passionate kiss.

We French kiss each other for a breathless eternity. Then I can hear the waiter cough discreetly behind me. <Monsieur, votre cravatte...> I break away, open my eyes and and see that Hisao's tie is hanging right in the middle of the sauce! We both become as red as lobsters.
<Ah, T-Thank you!> I say. The waiter helpfully passes Hisao a cloth and some salt to clean it up.
<I am sorry to have disturbed you Madame, Monsieur. But I am glad to zee you are enjoying our etablissement.> the waiter jokes to break the awkward mood.
<With my lovely wife, how could I not enjoy?> Hisao replies.
<Of course, your wife is zo very lovely. My congratulationz to both of you! But I shall bozer you no more.> the waiter says as he smiles kindly, and then leaves us to our privacy.

Lovely... the waiter clearly saw my scars, and yet he said such a thing. He might have been joking, but then again.... They say love makes a woman beautiful... perhaps that is why? I see Hisao still is smirking a bit at his own clumsiness, and I giggle a bit again in return.
"Yet another good memory." he says. And I just nod, and smile the the biggest smile I ever had.

Part 5 - Dessert

We finish our dinner. We both had three glasses of wine, and I'm feeling a bit tipsy. Hisao's face also looks a little red. Hidao asks for the check, and puts the money on the silver platter. And since it's not uncommon to do so here, he leaves a generous tip for the kind waiter as well. 
"Do you still want to go to another place?" Hisao asks. 
"Well, I want to go back to eat our D-desert." I say as I hint at the bag. "But from here we have to change trains once at the Opera." 
"It must be beautiful now, " Hisao says like he reads my mind, "So why don't we go up once to see it." he suggests. 
"It's a plan!" I nod happily.

We step outside of the restaurant, and the waiter bids us goodbye with smile and a wave. Outside it's already getting darker, the sun is setting, our two joined shadows are long.  Hand in hand we walk to the Metro station, go down and take the train. Then at the Opera station, we make our way up. I climb up the final flight of stairs, turn around and immediately see the Opera building in front of me. Already it's lit up with spotlights, gold and white glistening against the deep purple of the evening sky.

I shiver a bit from the cool breeze, and Hisao hugs me from behind. He puts his arms around my waist. I enjoy his warmth, and put my arms under his. Slowly, I slide up my hands, so Hisao's fingertips are pushed against the underside of my breasts. Maybe he doesn't notice what I'm doing? I stand just like that, for a few minutes. I marvel at the building and take in the smells of the city and the feel of Hsao's body, until I feel something hard poking in my back...

"Eh, well, let's take a picture then." Hisao says quickly as he lets go of me. Is it just my imagination or does he look even more red than before? I take out the camera, and take a picture of the building, then I look for some helpful passerby. An older lady accepts to take our photo, and I hug Hisao closely from the side, smiling widely.
<Alala, les amoureux! Amusez vous bien cette nuit!> she smiles. I don't know what that means, but the wink she gives us tells me enough. I get my camera back and thank her with a bow.

Hisao still seems a bit embarrassed, so I just take his hand and we walk down the stairs into the metro. We take the train towards our hotel. Hisao sits next to me and I lean my head on his shoulder. Unfortunately the ride is quite short, so I don't get to enjoy his that as long as I would have liked. Silently, we leave the metro, and head back to the hotel, up to our room.

I feel a tension in the air as Hisao opens the door for me and lets me in. It's now or never, I think! A cultural difference... I have to show it to him now! Before Hisao is well and good inside the suite, I turn on the lights, step out of my boots, and go sit on the bed.
"Gimme the chocolate, Hisao." I say with a smile.
"Oh, you can't wait to eat your dessert?" he smiles as he walks over and hands me the bag "You really love chocolate, huh?" 

I take out a chocolate bar and peel off the wrapper.
"Y-yes... but today... H-Hisao.... Today, this bar is your... thing." I start to lick the top of the bar, first just with the tip of my tongue, and then with big licks. Then I take part of it inside my mouth and suck on it, slurping quite noisily.

I look up at Hisao, but his face looks is puzzled, so with my left hand, I start rubbing the bulge in his pants. I rub and suck on the chocolate for a minute or so, as Hisao stands and gasps, until I feel he is getting hard. I switch the bar to my left hand, and with my right, I open his zipper, and reach into his pants.

"Hanako, you don't have to..." he starts, as he finally understand what I want to do, but my hand finds what I am looking for and grabs it tightly. The rest of his words are lost in a groan. I carefully pull Hisao's thing out, and I stroke it slowly, as I suck on the chocolate. Hisao puts up no more resistance and drops his pants and briefs. I blow on Hisao's thing, and then give the tip a quick lick. Then I lick the chocolate bar, then again Hisao, and over and over again. Hisao's breath becomes ragged and he puts his hands gently on my shoulders.

The bittersweet taste of chocolate mixes with the salty taste of his skin and the drops of ...liquid that drip out. I put the bar aside, my hand sticky with molten brown cocoa. I kneel down on the floor next to the bed, and turn Hisao towards me. Then I grab his thing at the root with both hands and take the tip in my mouth, sucking and slurping. I never did this before, so I don't know what I'm doing, but I try to copy what I saw on TV as well as I can. Oh yes, I should do more, right?

By now I'm getting very excited myself. I move my head backwards and forwards with  Hisao's tip in my mouth and his groans become louder and louder. I don't worry anymore about the stickiness of my brown hands, and I put them on Hisao's hips. I feel a bit nervous whether I can pull it off, but I'm determined. So I push his thing all the way in my mouth until I'm kissing his ... golden balls. His tip touches the back of my throat and I cough a bit. But he is not that big, so it fits without much discomfort.

Hisao suddenly pulls away, I look up and see his face looks worried. 
"Hanako, you really don't have to..." I raise my chocolate covered finger and put it on his lips...
"P-please don't say anything, Hisao..." I silence him. More, I have to do more for my husband! Maybe then he can finally be excited about me! 
"J-just fuck my mouth!" I almost shout. Then I take both his hands and put them on the back of my neck. Yes, that's how they do it, right? I put my hands on Hisao's bottom and take his all of his thing in my mouth again.

Ardently I slide my head forward and backwards, sucking and slurping as much as I can. At first Hisao is reluctant, but then I feel he pushes my neck and thrusts his hips in response to my motions. I look up and see that his face is ecstatic. "Hanako, I love you!" he shouts with a breaking voice.
"Hisao I love you! I want you! Fuck my like this every day!" I want to shout, but because Hisao keeps on moving my head and my mouth is full, it just comes out as
"Hmmma hahmm hamma hammah hamahamm hahamam hamm". And then suddenly Hisao stiffens, shouts, and my throat fills with his salty seed.

I cough loudly as I swallow half of it. No, I overdid it! He came, but I still want to do more! And he didn't understand what I said! Hisao quickly pulls away, looks for a tissue and and gently wipes my mouth clean. He must have noticed my disappointed look, because he bows to me.
"I'm so sorry Hanako, I shouldn't have!" he apologizes. No, I don't want him to apologize. I wanted this!
"I-It's OK." I say. No! Why is that all I can say now!? I must do something quickly... 

I stand up and take off my skirt, stockings and panties in one go. Then I take the chocolate bar again and rub it against my lips down there.
"D-don't you want dessert too?" I ask. Hisao seems to cheer up a bit at this, and kneels in front off me. 
"I'll humbly partake" he says, with a strangely serous look on his face. I pass him the chocolate and he rubs it on a bit more. Then with gentle flicks of his tongue,  he slowly licks it off. I gasp wordlessly as I feel the warm pleasure shiver though my body. I go to sit down on the bed, and open my legs widely. Hisao accepts my invitation, and licks more eagerly and more deeply now. 

"Hisao!" I shout as he turns his tongue in circles around my sensitive spot. I feel overwhelmed by a wave of pleasure that rises from my hips. I thrust my pelvis up and down to follow the motions of Hisao's tongue. I rub his hair with my hands, and wrap my legs around his neck, as he licks and slurps again and again.
"Hisao I ... Aeiiiii!" I shout, and then my body shudders and shakes and I see nothing but heavenly whiteness as I come.

I lie back and close my eyes. Hisao, today, I also wasn't able to say what I wanted to say. Or at least, I didn't say it in a way you could understand. But it felt so good. Tomorrow, I will try again! I will try again every day... My eyes are heavy from the of the wine and the love making...I can't seem to open them anymore... My breathing slows down. And I fall asleep.

Part 6 -- Mysterious

The faint light of morning shines though my closed eyelids. I open them and find that I' lying in bed, covered up with a sheet and a blanket. Next to me I hear Hisao's slow breathing. He's still asleep. Last night he must have covered me up without waking me. He's so kind. I smile. Then I notice there is still chocolate on my hands, and I feel a bit itchy down there, so I silently slip out if the bed and head for the bathroom.

First I use the toilet and wipe a bit down there. Running a shower would make too much noise, so I plug the washbasin, and let warm water slowly flow inside. I look in the mirror. There are brown smears over my face as well, so I wash my hands and my face, before I take off my blouse and bra. Then I rub my lips down there clean. Hmmm... yesterday felt so nice, it was different, much more exciting and fun. We never did that before, and Hisao...

Hiaso also never did that before. I frown... How did he know what to do? It couldn't be... Does he have a girlfriend who taught him? Ah, but... no, he wouldn't right? Besides I also never did that before, and I learned it from that movie. He must also have seen it some perverted manga or anime something like that.

I remember when we moved into our apartment. There was a box with his name on, and he requested that I didn't look inside it. I want to respect my husband's privacy so I didn't think anything of it then. But now I see... he must have lot of perverted stuff in that box! And that means... he can't get excited about me, so he uses that to make do...

I see my face has completely clouded up now as if I'm ready to cry. Hisao, yesterday was not different. It was the same as always. I remember the first time, I just took of my clothes, forbade him to speak, and I made him do what I wanted him to do to me. It was bit painful then because we were both virgins, but I really enjoyed the thought of finally having sex with him. And after that, those twenty two other times, went much the same. Well, they were more fun than the first time because I found out soon how to do it right. Hisao must have done the same.

But I always shut him up. I don't listen to what he has to say. I'm so lewd that I always simply force him to do what I want. I know Hisao really loves me, and I love him. He doesn't coddle or pity me, and he lets me take care of him as well as he takes care of me. But when it comes to sex... He must have been overwhelmed by me.  I'm not exciting at all, with my body like that, and his heart condition makes it hard on him too. And I do nothing but crave for him like he's a piece of chocolate.

Yesterday too, I made him shut up. And shouting at him to fuck me... that's not a good way to talk to him... I wonder why it's so hard for me to talk to Hisao about my desires. We can talk about almost everything, our feelings, our ideas, our friends, our work, anything. But it's as if because I feel so close to him, that the topic of sex is just too embarrassing, too lewd. I feel like if I say that I want to have sex with him every day, he will think of me as if I had asked him to rob a bank every day, or even like I asked him to to eat a turd every day...

I look at myself in the mirror again. I look like a dejected old lady now. No, I promised... I won't be bitter! I try to cheer up, and I'm reminded of the wink that lady at the opera gave us. I try to wink myself, but only manage to blink both my eyes at the same. Strange, it's really true we Japanese have a hard time winking. I put my hand over my right eye and close it, and I keep my left eye open. Then I slide my right hand down. Ah, yes, that's more like a wink, isn't it?

A cultural difference. I remember reading in the guide book that French people often freely show their emotions. I look at the water. The sink has filled up and starts to overflow though the second hole. Overflow. I have to open the sink, otherwise it will overflow. I pull out the stopper and watch the dirty water flow out. This sink is like my heart. I have to open it up, or it will overflow too. The dirt will remain inside if I don't. I nod with a determined look on my face. Now I know what I have to do.

But first things first. We have tickets for the Louvre for this morning. The tickets are on hour, and we have to be there punctually. If we miss our time we won't be able to visit and we'll lose our money as well. So, we should get ready and head down to eat breakfast early. I step out of the bathroom for a moment to look at the clock. We will have to hurry a bit. I walk over to Hisao and go sit next to him, and wake him with a kiss. He blinks as he looks at me.

"Good morning, Hanako." he says with a faint smile. I can see him glance at my breasts.
"Good morning, Hisao." I say. He quickly sits up.
"Oh, right, today is the Louvre!" He says and looks at the clock. "Not much time left, and I didn't shower last night!". Of course, he didn't want the sound to wake me up.
"I only washed my hands and face, I also still need a shower.  So let's take one together?" I suggest.
"Good idea Hanako, it will be faster that way!"

We head over to the shower and step in together. I turn the tap until I find a water temperature we can both enjoy. I take the small soap bar in my hands and wash Hisao's back. I pass him the soap and turn around. He gently rubs and massages my back as he works up a lather and rinses. I'd love him to repeat, but we have to hurry, so we finish our shower together.

Hisao steps out first and hands me a big towel with both hands. I step forwards against the towel and he rubs me dry. Then I take a towel and rub Hisao's body as well. Hisao then dries his hair with a towel, and I use the hotel's hairdryer, which turns to be remarkably powerful. We step out of the bathroom and get dressed.

"I still have to put my make-up on." I say, as I head back to the bathroom.
"If you're OK with it, I'll already go down and get us some breakfast." Hisao says.
"Ok, I'll come down after you. Hot chocolate and toast for me, please!" I say. I hear Hisao head out. I take out the Covermark but then I decide against it. No, not today. I won't cover up. Not my face, and not my feelings, even if they are ugly. So I just apply some light foundation, draw my eyebrows and put on some lipstick. Kiss proof. I hope I will need it.

It looks like today will also be sunny, so I just take my purse, the tickets for the Louvre, and the room key, and step into my boots. I head down and after getting lost a bit, one of the staff members shows me the way to the breakfast room. Hisao waves me over to his table. Two plates with two toasts each, a hot chocolate and tea. The breakfast is buffet style, but we have to hurry a bit, so we quickly gobble down our food without talking.

"Everything set?" Hisao says as he gets up.
"Yes, let's go!" I say.
We walk out of the room, though the lobby and outside. We make a brisk walk to the metro, and after a change of trains we end up at the station near the Louvre. I look at my watch..
"Only ten minutes..."  I say.
"Let's run, Hanako!" Hisao takes my arm in his and together we dash up the stairs to the museum. I giggle all the way and I see him smile too.
The guard looks a cross at us as we almost fall at the door. Hisao opens it for me. I enter while I breathe raggedly. Hisao feels his chest, smiles at me as a sign that everything is OK, and then follows behind me. I look for to the desk for prepaid tickets. Fortunately there is no queue there so I make it in time.

The Louvre is huge, and I want to visit that other place this afternoon, so with the book, I guide Hisao around the most famous paintings, skipping over the others. After seeing several masterpieces, we pass by "Liberty Leading the People".
"Nice, but I like your breasts better!" Hisao jokes.
"T-thank you!" I smile. Well, there's no other Japanese nearby so no one can understand the compliment anyway. And it makes me really happy!

Then after a few more paintings and statues we head down to the famous "Mona Lisa". The room is busy. I admire the picture from some distance.
"Her smile is really mysterious." I say.
"I think it is because she had great sex the night before." Hisao whispers in my ear.
"You think so?" I whisper, then I step back and show my face to Hisao as I try to imitate the painting's expression as well as I can.
"Definitely!" He whispers back in my ear.
And we both burst out in laughter. Some of the other tourists frown at us.

"They're getting miffed. Let's escape!" I elbow his arm with a flawless wink. Good thing I practiced winking this morning! He takes my arm and guides me out of the room though a few corridors, until we're away from the crowd. Then he turns to me, lifts up my chin with his hand, and gives me a passionate French kiss.
"Hisao..." I say. "Let's go somewhere else." I smile. He will understand! 

I take his hand again, and after some more corridors, room and stairs, we walk out of the Louvre. I lead Hisao into the metro. We step into the train and sit down. Not far from us we can see a young couple kissing each other.
"Let's show them that the French have nothing on us Japanese" he whispers in my ear. Then he turns his face to mine again and I open my mouth to let his tongue in as we kiss even more passionately and deeply than before. My tongue fools around against Hisao's for minutes. Surely he will understand!

<Pigalle> A voice announces. I break the kiss. 
"It's here, quick!" I say, and pull Hisao off the train. The door buzzes and snaps closed right behind him.
"That was close!" he says.
We're both laughing like madmen again.
I jump up, wrap my hands around Hisao's shoulders and hug him.
"I love you Hisao!" I say.
"Watch it, you're going to make me fall on the rails." he says with mock indignation. He carries me for a few steps as I hang from his shoulders, then he puts me back down on my feet. "But I'll forgive you because you are my beloved wife." he says and kisses my forehead. Certainly, he will understand!



Part 7 -- Sacred

I climb out of the metro with Hisao by my side. It's around noon. The sun is high in the sky  I'm feeling a bit hungry, especially since I only ate two toasts for breakfast.
"Is there any place we can eat?" I ask and look around left and right. Hisao looks across the street at a McDonalds.
"Would you like to eat hamburgers?" I ask.
"No, two days in a row would be too much." Hisao says.
"It's OK! It's our honeymoon, so you can eat your favorite as much as you like." I smile and wink. This is fun actually, I could get used to winking at Hisao a lot.
"But Hanako, aren't you getting bored of eating the same food every day?"
"I'm sorry I didn't tell you before, Hisao. I love hamburgers!" I say.
"Glad to hear that!" he beams "Well then, don't mind if I do." We cross the street and enter the greasy halls of the golden arches.

I point my finger at the images on the menu again, but this time I choose a
McChicken menu, and I order a Big Mac menu with a side salad for Hisao. Just like yesterday, we go sit down at a small table in a corner. As I take a sip from my cola Hisao softly punches my shoulder.
"Will you squirt in my face again today?" he jokes. I put my finger on top of the straw and pull it out from the cup. I put the straw to my lips and blow the liquid left inside at his nose.
"You asked for it!" I giggle like a child, like I am 7 years again, and as if nothing bad has ever happened to me in my whole life. Because that is how I feel now, happy like a child. Hisao wipes his nose with a napkin.
"You should aim for my mouth, so I can drink it." Hisao says, and he sticks out his tongue. I laugh so hard the scars on my side starts to hurt.

I manage to stop my giggling enough to eat my hamburger. Hisao also gets a hold of himself and chews on his bread and beef. Then Hisao dutifully eats his veggies.
"I must say I envy you a little, you get to eat fries." he says.
"You asked for the salad yourself." I say. I take a fry, wave it under his nose, and quickly eat it.
"Are you trying to seduce me?" He says with a fake sour grin.
"Who knows?" I wink again.  Well, yes I want to seduce Hisao, but just now I was only teasing him a bit.

"Say Hanako, when did you learn how to wink?" Hisao asks.
"You noticed? I saw many people here do that, so I taught it myself this morning." I say.
"Interesting... Let me see if I can do it too." he says. He closes both his eyes.
"No, like this." I cover his left eye with my hand. After a few tries, he finally gets it right too. I wink at him. He winks back. I wink again. He winks back again. I wink yet again. Then I notice and old man who sits a bit further wink at me. No, I wasn't winking at you! I point my finger at my husband. The old man makes a face of understanding and looks away.

"It's not polite to point!" Hisao mockingly chides me. He grabs my finger and kisses it. I pull it away from his hand and put it on his chest.
"I was just pointing out that old man over there that it's you who I belong to." I say.
"Then I'd better also point out the person I belong to." He puts his finger on my breast. Yes Hisao, like that! But, not here, not yet! 
"Thank you Hisao." I say "But let's get going. We can't sit here winking and pointing all day." I say. So we drink our drinks and take turns at going to the toilet. Then we step out on the street again.

"Where to now? " Hisao asks.
"We should go up" I say. and I guide him in the direction of a sloping street. The direct way is shorter, but I want to set the mood first. And besides, it would be a waste not to go up there while we are close by. After walking a few minutes through uphill streets, we reach stairs that climb up a green field in which. I can already see our next stop on top of the hill. There is a sort of elevator to the side of the field. The stairs would be too tiring so I pay for the fare and we ride it up. I climb another flight of stairs with Hisao holding my hand. In front of us stands a large white domed building.

"That is the Sacre Coeur Basillica." I say.
"Impressive!" Hisao says as he turns around. "And look at the view. I think I can see our hotel from up here."
"No way!" I punch his back softly. This light feeling in my heart, this banter between us... did it only start yesterday? I'd like it to continue forever... I look out on the city. It really is lovely. Everything looks so small from here. Even the Eiffel tower.
"You want to go in?" Hisao asks. I nod and grab his hand again. We cross the street, 
climb up and enter through the gate. Inside the basilica we make our way around. I look up at the large mosaic, the statues, and at the stained glass windows.

At one side there is an altar with many candles in front of it. I don't believe in God very much, but there is something I want to wish for. I take out a coin, put it in the offertory box, take a fresh candle, and light it. I set it down between the other lit candles. I clap my hands in front of my face and bow my head. What I wish for is not just happiness for myself. There is something I want more.

"Dear God, dear parents," I pray silently, "please protect my husband, Hisao. May he be happy. May his troubles and pains be taken away. May all his wishes come true. May he be enlightened. May he be happy."  It's a Buddhist prayer, since I don't know any Christian ones. But I feel God won't discriminate against people for their beliefs or religion. I just hope Someone will hear my wish and make it come true.

I turn back to Hisao who still looks around and waits for me to finish my prayer. I walk up to him and when he sees I have finished, he follows me as I silently leave the domed building. Outside again, I lean close to him and lock my arm in his. I look out on the panoramic view, with Hisao's warmth next to me and I am amazed at the depth of my own bliss. Hisao doesn't ask me anything, so I just guide him along the street, around the church, as I quietly enjoy just being together with him.

We come up to a crowded square were many painters are sitting in front of their easels. There are many restaurants around the square and many tourists are sitting on the terraces for a meal or a drink. I don't like crowds like this too much, and I don't feel like talking, so I just lead Hisao around the square. From time to time I stop for a moment to see what the artist is drawing, and then continue on to the next one. Hisao also seems to enjoy himself as he silently walks with me. 

I don't want to stay here very long, but it is on the way to my goal for today. I feel at peace and ready to speak my mind. From the square we take a narrow street down, and after some curbs and crossroads we end up with a wide boulevard in front of us. I see Hisao look with some surprise at where we ended up, but he seems to understand that I don't want to talk to him for a while. Not yet. To our right is the Moulin Rouge... That might be nice for Hisao, but I'm not very interested in seeing other women's breasts.  In stead, I turn to the left, with Hisao still on my right arm. Finally we reach our goal. 

Hisao raises his eyebrows, but politely opens the door for me. We head in, and I buy two tickets for us. The museum is full of paintings, drawings, photographs and ancient objects. And each and every one of them is related to sex. I'm getting a little nervous, but also excited by looking at these depictions. I take Hisao slowly past all of these works of erotic art and I can see he is looking just as carefully at them as I am. Like this I take him up the stairs, though the different floors of the museum until we reach the top. I'm glad nobody else is there. I don't have to wait to speak any longer.

I let go of Hisao's arm, turn to face him, and take both his hands between my hands.
"Hisao" I say "can I talk with you?" 
"Hanako, of course!" he says.
"T-there is a reason I took you here." I begin. "I-it has also to do with what happened last night..."
"Ah, yes?" he says with a mixof surprise and kindness in his face.
"You see Hisao, I love you and I am very happy to be with you..." I continue "But I have been d-dishonest with you. And also, I have b-been disrespectful."
"Dishonest? Disrespectful? But how so?" he frowns in disbelief.
"I was dishonest because I hid away a b-bad part of me. And I was d-disrespectful because I forced my feelings on you." I say.
"But Hanako, I don't think there is anything bad about you." he says.
"That's... I-I hid it very well. In reality.... Hisao, I am a very l-lewd woman. I m-masturbate almost every day. Every time I am with you I want to have s-sex with you so very much. I want you... I want you to f-fuck me every day... yes.. fuck me , Hisao, not once, but many times... every day. You see how lewd I am, that I use s-such words? But I know, I know, I'm completely u-unreasonable. I'm not considerate of your c-condition and you as a person. I keep on p-pushing you to do what I want, I keep on s-shutting you up, and I never listen to what you have to say about s-sex. So please f-forgive me for being so lewd. Please forgive me! I m-made you have sex with me, while I know you don't l-like to do it with me. It's all my f-fault because I am not sexy, not attractive, I'm u-ugly and I'm lewd." I say as I look down and I cry profusely. 

Hisao pulls his hands from between mine, and puts them on my cheeks. He makes me look up at him. Then with one hand, he gives me a light bop on the forehead. 
"You never told me." he says with a thin smile on his face. 
"That's right... I never told you... but I should have." I say dejectedly.
"No, not this. You never told me that you like sex." he says with his smile widening.
"H-Hisao?" I say. It's true. I never told him. I though the had understood me, but how could he? Shouts of pain or shouts of pleasure both sound quite the same. I never had bothered to say as much as a Hisao, that was great.
"I-It's true. I really love to have sex with you!" I say. "B-but what about you?"
"Hanako, all this time, I thought you must not like sex very much. After all, we only did it a few times, and you always just take off your clothes and let me do what I want. So I thought you were just having sex with me for my sake. You always ask me not to speak, so I always just went ahead. But I should have asked you.  But I was too much a coward to say anything. I was afraid I'd offend you.  So it's me who is lewd, dishonest and disrespectful." he says, and pauses. 
"Hisao! That's all wrong. I love to have sex with you! I love you, I love your mind, your heart, your body and everything. And I love to have sex with you so very much." I say.
"Hanako! I already thought something was strange after what happened last night, and I wonder why you took me here, but now I understand. Hanako, you and me, we are the same! I was also too shy, too embarrassed and to stubborn to admit it. But I love you, everything about you, all your mind, your heart, your body, you are all beautiful to me. And I also love to have sex with you very much!" he says.

I feel myself melting with relief, with happiness, and with desire. Yes, we are the same! Dear parents, dear God! We are the same! Now, I will not have to hold back anymore! All these emotions wheel through my heart like a tornado, and I find that I cannot wait anymore. I forcefully grab Hisao's head, and thrust my tongue between his lips. He immediately grabs my breasts, and I moan loudly. I put my hand in the middle of his pants and start rubbing. Hisao lifts me up and sits me on top of one of the exposition boxes.
<We are pleazed that you enzoy our muzeum, but as not to damage ze collection, may I zuggest you continue in a more private locazion?>  the guard of the museum says. 
"Kyah!" I shout. Hisao breaks away and turns around. I quickly step down from the glass box. Now I notice the a security camera that looks right at the display!
<We are sorry, we just got a bit carried away.> Hisao says and he bows deeply. I bow too, my face more red than it has ever been.
<Apology aczepted! You are not the only customerz who have had this problem. This is the erotic muzeum of Paris after all!> the guard says as he smirks. 
I and Hisao bow again. 
<Thank you so much! We won't do it again!> I say with heartfelt regret.
<Well, zhen, off you go! You muzt have better thingz to do than to ztand here and bow to me!> the guard winks and laughs loudly. 
<Ah yes!><Ah yes!> we both shout. I feel embarrassed as I walk down the stairs and leave the building with Hisao behind me. But outside I take a good look at him and grab hold of his hands. He looks back at me and we burst out in laughter.

"Well, Hanako, we did get carried away a bit. We still have a lot of time in our honeymoon, so there's no need to rush. Let's go sit down somewhere quiet and talk more calmly about you and me, and how our sex life together should be."  he says. 
"Yes, let's do that." I say "But right know I'm so glad. You understood what I wanted to say." 
"Well, I understood a few things. But that's not enough. We have to talk more. We have to keep on talking to each other all our lives. About sex, about love, about life, about everything."  Hisao says.
"You are right. We have to talk,  even if it's embarrassing or shameful, or even if it means we have to admit our own flaws. To be completely happy, we have to be completely open to each other." I say.
"It's a promise!" Hisao says, and he hooks his little finger in mine.
"A promise!" I say. And we kiss again. I feel this afternoon we will learn a lot more about each other. And tonight... I can't wait for tonight to come. 


Part 8 -- 

Ten steps away from where we were standing is a rather large café. While there are a few customers, there are no Asian people inside, so I point out a spot to Hisao and we go sit there.
